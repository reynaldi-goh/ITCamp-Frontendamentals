# 🧪 Exercise 2: Branching

## Goal
Create a new branch and upload changes.  
> You can use **VS Code Source Control** or **Git commands in the terminal**, whichever you prefer.

## Steps

1. Create and switch to a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
   ```

2. Edit `hello.txt` and update the content to:

   ```bash
   I love <type anything you like>
   ```

3. **Commit** your changes using either VS Code Source Control or Git commands.

4. **Push** your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

   > Check your forked repository to see the new branch.

5. Switch back to `main` to see that your changes are isolated:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
